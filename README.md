# Cohort Retention Analysis with SQL

This repository contains SQL scripts and documentation for performing Cohort Retention analysis on customer data. Cohort Retention analysis is a valuable technique for understanding customer behavior over time, tracking customer retention, and identifying opportunities for improvement.

## About

Cohort Retention analysis is a method for studying how different cohorts of customers behave over time. It allows you to answer questions like:

- How long do customers typically stay with our product or service?
- What percentage of customers return after their initial purchase?
- How does customer behavior change over time within different cohorts?

This project focuses on implementing retention cohort analysis using SQL on customer data.
